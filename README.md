# SOL COUPS

SOL Coups is a user-friendly application designed to help users buy gift vouchers in exchange for their SOL coins. This project leverages the Solana blockchain to provide a quick and secure way for users to swap their cryptocurrency for gift cards.<br>

## Getting Started

To ensure the application displays correctly, **please open only the `index.html` file** in your browser. Opening other files directly may cause incomplete or incorrect rendering.

### Prerequisites

1. The latest version of any js supporting webbrowser, e.g., [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/what-you-make-of-it/).
2. A directory to store all our files seperately :)
3. A crypto wallet that supports the Solana blockchain (such as, [Phantom Wallet](https://phantom.app/)). **Please ensure payments are made through a Solana Devnet account.**

### Installing

Download the files and save them to a directory on your local machine. Once downloaded, extract the files, and you're all set!

## How to Run

1. Navigate to the `index.html` file in your file system.
2. Ensure that all other files in the project are in their original locations relative to `index.html`.
3. Open `index.html` file in your browser. 

### An Example Run

Following these steps will ensure that the application functions as intended.
If you encounter any issues, please make sure you are running `index.html` and not any other files directly.<br>
<br>
The page should look something like this-

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>
  <div>
    <img src='images/page1.png' alt='The homepage'>
  </div>
</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<br>

By providing your email address and the amount you want for your gift voucher, SOL Coups will calculate the approximate INR value you need to send via crypto to obtain your desired voucher. The application will then direct you to the next page to finalize your payment details.

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>
  <div>
    <img src='images/page2.png' alt='Payment Details'>
  </div>
</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<br>

Once a valid sender's wallet address is provided, you will be directed to the payment gateway. A 5-minute window will open for you to complete the payment using your **Solana devnet account.**

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>
  <div>
    <img src='images/page3.1.png' alt='Payment Gateway'>
  </div>
</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<br>

Upon successful payment, the text on the page will be updated, and a confirmation email containing a randomly generated code will be sent to the email address you provided.

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>
  <div>
    <img src='images/page3.2.png' alt='Payment Status'>
  </div>
</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<br>

Email that is recieved-
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>
  <div>
    <img src='images/email.png' alt='Recieved Email'>
  </div>
</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<br>
